## Pupil Visualizer

The Pupil Visualizer records the area and position of a pupil over time. Ultimately the user's pupil will be mapped using an infrared camera, but for now infrared video footage is used in place of a user's eye.

#### Use

Open Pupil Finder in Xcode and CVFP1_3 (inside the Pupil Visualizer folder) in Processing. Run both programs simultaneously.
